# Designing a Basic Mobile and Web Layout for Zomato – Case Study
1) Applying Gestalt Principles to Enhance Design

Gestalt principles are foundational in crafting a visually intuitive and user-friendly layout for Zomato. The principle of proximity is utilized to cluster related elements such as restaurant names, cuisine tags, star ratings, and pricing within concise, visually unified cards. This enables users to process grouped information quickly without cognitive overload. Similarity strengthens consistency across the app by maintaining a uniform design for all action buttons (e.g., “Order Now,” “Add to Cart”) and icons (e.g., delivery, vegetarian symbol), which helps users immediately identify familiar actions. Continuity enhances user engagement by organizing featured categories such as "Top Picks," "Trending Now," and "Quick Delivery" into horizontally scrollable sections, encouraging smooth left-to-right scanning. Closure is achieved through partial visual frames (like rounded containers or image overlays), allowing the user's mind to complete the shape and understand the grouping even if it's not fully bordered. The figure/ground principle ensures clarity by using background blur effects and contrast layering, which visually separates interactive elements like CTAs from the busy background of food imagery, drawing the user's attention to what matters most.

2) Incorporating UI Elements and Design Patterns

Both mobile and web layouts are built on fundamental UI components that promote ease of use, clarity, and scalability. On the mobile layout, the top app bar includes the Zomato logo, a geolocation button to auto-detect delivery location, and a search icon for quick access. Below it, filter chips allow users to sort restaurants by cuisine, rating, delivery time, or offers. The main content features card-style listings displaying a restaurant image, name, cuisine, distance, price range, rating, and a call-to-action button. A bottom navigation bar gives quick access to Home, Explore, Orders, and Profile, enabling smooth navigation throughout the app. For the web layout, a responsive header bar includes a prominently displayed search bar, logo, and user profile menu. A left sidebar helps filter by price range, customer ratings, food type (Veg/Non-Veg), and delivery speed. The main content area uses a grid layout that accommodates more listings per row while maintaining a clean and balanced design. Reusable design patterns such as modals for detailed views, tooltips for icons, and breadcrumb navigation on the order tracking page further enhance usability.

3) Developing Interaction Behaviors and Usability Principles

Interaction behaviors across both mobile and web layouts are designed with user-centered principles in mind. Visual feedback mechanisms are implemented throughout the interface—for instance, when a user taps a button, it changes color or exhibits a ripple effect to acknowledge the interaction. Web users experience hover effects on clickable items, helping distinguish active from inactive areas. Affordances are built into the design—buttons appear raised and clickable, input fields are underlined, and tabs slide smoothly, guiding users on what action to take next. Navigation is kept minimal but highly functional. On mobile, a sticky bottom nav ensures primary options are always accessible, while swipe gestures enable smooth transitions between restaurant cards or category tabs. On the web, content dynamically adjusts to screen size, ensuring a seamless experience whether viewed on a desktop or tablet. Accessibility features include high-contrast text, keyboard navigation, image alt texts, and support for screen readers. Usability testing insights guide layout choices such as large touch targets, minimal load time, and simplified checkout flow. Together, these practices support a wide range of users, including those with varying levels of digital literacy.
